WikiPraktik Template for DokuWiki

All documentation for this template can be found at
https://www.dokuwiki.org/template:wikipraktik

Installation and upgrading of templates is automated by using
the Extension Manager in DokuWiki. It lets you search for and install
templates automatically.

However, if you install this plugin manually, make sure it is
installed in lib/tpl/wikipraktik - if the folder has a different name,
it will not work.

Please refer to https://www.dokuwiki.org/template for additional info
on how to install templates in DokuWiki.
